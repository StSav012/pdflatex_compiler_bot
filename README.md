# pdflatex_compiler_bot

This Telegram bot gets ZIP archives containing full LaTeX projects and tries to build a PDF file based on their content.

Currently, the LaTeX compiler is hardcoded to be PDFLaTeX, the bibliography processor is `bibtex`. 

I do not promise that the bot is always online. Moreover, I encourage you to clone the repo and run the bot on your
machine, for I can not spend all my computer power to others' needs. My PC is just not fast enough to serve everyone.
Therefore, I do not provide you with a link.
